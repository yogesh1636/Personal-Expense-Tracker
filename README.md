# Personal Expense Tracker

A beginner-friendly Python project to help track daily spending, categorize expenses, and improve money management using simple file handling and terminal interaction.

## Purpose

This project is designed for those wanting to learn core Python programming concepts such as file handling, data structures, and loops, while building a practical tool for personal finance tracking.

## Features

- **Add Daily Expenses:** Record purchases like food, travel, or shopping, and log their amounts.
- **Categorize Expenses:** Organize spending under categories such as Entertainment, Essentials, or Savings.
- **Persistent Storage:** All data is saved in `expenses.txt` using Python file operations so records are retained across sessions.
- **Spending Summaries:** Instantly display total money spent today, this week, or over the current month for greater financial awareness.

## Technical Concepts Covered

- File handling: `open`, `read`, and `write` to manage the expense file.
- Lists and dictionaries: Store and organize expense data for efficient access and aggregation.
- Loops and conditionals: Process multiple entries, filter data, and generate summaries.
- Terminal UI: Simple, menu-driven interface for easy user interaction and input.
